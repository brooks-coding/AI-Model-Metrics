# TimeGPT Model Metrics Analysis

This project was done as part of a previous internship at AtlasFX. It conducts time series model cross validation for Nixtla's TimeGPT through the fitting of several machine learning models found in the SciKit-Learn Python package. All code is free for reproduction, but the data used in my analysis will not be due to client confidentiality.
